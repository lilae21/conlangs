# lilae21/conlangs *repository*
A static website to present my conlanging and conworlding work.

***

My website is the primary public piece of documentation on my — *lilae21* — conlanging and conworlding work. Ever since about 2015 I had been sharing my work on social media *silos* or on collaborative conlanging wikis, but this project was started as a means of organizing myself my entire work.

Further information on the website's [home page](https://lilae21.github.io/conlangs/index.htm).
