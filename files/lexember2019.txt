Chlouvānem (theme: "basic computing" (mostly continued from yesterday's)):

- junairækirṣūs “brake pedal” (< junai (foot) + rækirṣūs)

Day 10:
Chlouvānem — theme: “things in a bathroom”

- šutogīmbān “forge” (< šutogīn)
(not counting this as a word, but I also decided that using metal names as pluralia tantum will have the meaning of collective nouns of products made from them, i.e. “-ware”: nāvlare “pewterware”, svālatāk “bronzeware”, kirme “ironware”, galkte “silverware”, etc.)

Day 13:

- šusnīrṣmęryūm “approval by censorship” - also commonly referred to by the acronym “šusnīyęri”, the authorization that allows any media to be published or transmitted in the Inquisition.

- yanacomboe — the colloquial euphemism for the approval by censorship, literally “gift from above”

Day 19:
Chlouvānem — “society of Antiquity (part 2)” (getting back to translating civics and technologies from Civilization VI: that's quite a good source for finding missing common words. This time it’s actually the game’s Classical Era, but I’ll still refer to it as Antiquity as “Classical Era” in Chlouvānem history mostly refers to a linguistic/literary stage, and the “Classical Era” of Western civilizations is something that has nothing to do with Chlouvānem)

Day 24 (text wall incoming!)
Chlouvānem — theme: “Kūlħanarai”

as a “Christmas special” or something like that, today's theme is very conworld-specific.

While there is no festivity with a symbology close to Christmas for the Chlouvānem, there is one in Aselism, the religion of Evandorian (Western) civilizations, also most widespread on Calémere - the festivity of Rebirth (Cálen Ecozóntan in Cerian), which has some parallels to Christmas being a religious feast with syncretic origins, the main gift-giving festivity in Western culture, and falling in winter - however it is a blending of different midwinter festivals, and it falls around 15 days after the Western New Year.

Rebirth is not celebrated in the Chlouvānem Inquisition (any non-Yunyalīlti festivity is banned) but it was once part of the culture in the Northwest, which had been colonized by Western powers before the Chlouvānem conquered it in modern times. Just north of the Northwest of the Inquisition is the cultural area of the Kenengyry peoples, which were a part of the Kaiṣamā (and millions of them, especially Soenjoans and Kuyugwazians, immigrated into the Inquisition at the time) and have their own winter festival, with roots in the common Kenengyry shamanism, with slightly varying traditions from people to people, and with cognate names in the various languages (for example “kuvul hynyrŏŋ” in Soenjoan or “kuy khanŭrokŭ” in Kuyugwazian).

During Kaiṣamā times, the authorities in the Inquisition in the Northwestern dioceses artificially created a new Yunyalīlti-friendly winter festival, the Kūlħanarai ([kuːɴ̆ħänäʀæɪ̯] in Standard Chl.; plurale tantum, likely from Soenjoan), blending Western Rebirth customs, which despite the bans was still followed by non-Chlouvānem in the Northwest, with those of the Kenengyry winter festival. Even its date – 29 haunyai (fifth month of the year, well in the middle of winter) – was chosen to be between the Western New Year (in the Chl. calendar usually on 21 haunyai) and Rebirth (4 and 5 laindyai, the following month (haunyai has 31 days)); note that the Kenengyry festival does not have a common set date across all Kenengyry peoples (the Džemlešwi, for example, celebrate it more than a month before the “Northwestern” Kūlħaranai), and for some of them it varies each year. The intent of this new festival was to prevent any non-Yunyalīlti derive of celebrating Rebirth or anti-Kaiṣamā ones from celebrating the Western New Year by shifting its imagery and merging it with another festivity from peoples of the Union.

Today, the Kūlħaranai are full public holidays in three dioceses (Srāmiṇajāṇai, Tārṣaivai, and Yultijaiṭa) and are observed and celebrated by most non-Chlouvānem (with the option for people celebrating it of not working) in two more (sparsely populated Ūnikadīltha and Līnajoṭa): basically, all of the Northeast except for the deserts of Samvālṣāṇṭrē (which were mostly uninhabited until modern times); nowadays people of all ethnicities celebrate it.

Now, today’s words:
- soruga “fermented mare milk” (< Soenjoan “sŏryg”) - it is the traditional Kenengyry drink and is still fairly popular in those countries, as well as a symbolic drink in festive occasions, especially inside the family. However, in the Chlouvānem Inquisition, it is not that widespread and quite expensive to get (compared to other foodstuffs); most Northwestern families try to get some for Kūlħaranai, and that makes up a good majority of the yearly consumption in the Inquisition.
- gūlṣaga (< Soen. “guol šag” ‘snow horse’), a mythical white horse that is the gift-giving figure for children during the Northwestern Kūlħanarai (which are, anyway, not the main gift-giving holiday - as in the rest of the Chlouvānem world, the Bhaivyāvāṣaryai near the summer solstice are). The gift-giver role is Western: the snow horse, in Kenengyry folklore, is a magical horse that runs over the land bringing snow, and has nothing to do with gifts.
- gūlṣaglāṇṭam (gūlṣaga + lāṇṭam “head”) - depiction of the head of the snow horse, a common Kūlħanarai decoration.
- malātas (< Auralian “mlaṣs”): typical Kūlħanarai treat, a cinnamon-flavoured cookie with candied fruit in its dough. With different names and typically different shapes, it is part of Rebirth traditions of various Southern Evandorian countries (most notably Auralia and Helinetia)
- yundahanā (< Soen. “ünda-khanaa” ‘apple paste’) - apple jam with spices, commonly eaten with Kūlħanarai treats.
- ndajlam (< Aur. “ntfaj nklemt” ‘garnished whale’) - Kūlħanarai dinner; the name refers to what formerly was the traditional course of Rebirth dinners in Southern Evandor, based on whale meat. The term spread to the Auralian colonies in today's Chlouvānem Northwest and then to the local Chlouvānem, even in the areas that were colonies of other countries where the main course of Rebirth dinners wasn’t whale meat. Anyway, whales rarely ever get anywhere close to the Northwest in the first place.
- batila - a small fish from the Carpan Sea (the inland sea the Northwest is washed by), which is a common year-round food, and in most of the Northwest fried batilai are the main course of a Kūlħanarai dinner.
- naṃdaṣa (< Soen. “namdaš”) - sour cream made from mare or camel milk.
- cūkṣarla (< Soen. “čüökh saryl”, lit. ‘horse puff’), another traditional Kūlħanarai food in the Northwest - a bite-sized puff pastry filled with minced seasoned horse meat. It is a common food in all Kenengyry countries, but its traditional place in winter festival meals is Soenjoan. In fact, “cūjaraṣi” (< Kuyugwazian “čüüh žaraš”) are the same thing (but can also have mare milk cheese as filling), and that word is more common outside of the Northwest, where they can be found as street food or    in Kenengyry restaurants. Northwesterners and Soenjoans in the Inquisition only call them “cūkṣarla”, Kuyugwazians call them “cūjaraṣi”, other Kenengyry and people from elsewhere or other ethnicities do not really care about the distinction and use the one they’re advertised with.
- trevna (< Aur. “trwen” ‘jelly’) - grape jelly, the entrée of any Kūlħanarai dinner; traditionally, in Southern Evandor, it was the first thing eaten after breaking the pre-Rebirth fast.


Day 25:
Chlouvānem — theme: “family bonds, celebrations”
- jaṃšāprimęlyanah “returning home to celebrate a festivity” (< jaṃšā “celebration, festivity” + primęlyanah “return”)

- meitotra “positivity” (< mei-ta-√ut-)

- irālkaplis “ground pollution” (< irāṇa “soil” + kaplis)
- nelikaplis “brainwashing” (< nelya “thought” + kaplis)

Day 27:
Chlouvānem — theme: “medieval society” (more Civ VI translations).
Our Middle Ages actually don’t really have a counterpart for the whole Chlouvānem world. Individual states or areas had dark ages, but Chlouvānem history is typically divided in periods by the spreading of the Yunyalīlti religion (and, together with that, Chlouvānem settling) in other areas. The period of the Toyubeshian Expansion more or less corresponds to the technology level of 12th century Europe. Feudal structures were in place in various areas of the Chlouvānem world, even if a good portion of lands were under monastic rule, and most notably the area of Lake Lūlunīkam and a large portion of the Lānamilūki valley was under sovereignty of the Inquisition itself (Līlasuṃghāṇa, the holy city founded to be the seat of Inquisitorial power (and to this day its capital), had been founded halfway through the Classical Era).

- karimbūkke (class 1 adjectival verb) “related to naval military, navigation, or naval engineering” (cf. the civic “Naval Tradition”, in Chl. “karimbūkire opašāmita”, where I could not use the genitive as it’d have been more like “tradition of [the/a single] ship”) (< karimbas “ship”)
- paṣlerjīn “governor” (< paṣ-√lerjy- “to steer, govern”)
- šupaṣlerjīn “vassal; official who has been granted land rights by a king” (< šu- “below” + paṣlerjīn)
- vṛṣṇa “feudal land right given to a vassal” (some dictionaries cite a Near Eastern origin, with the possible meaning of “ceremony”)
- vṛṣṇadarī “feudalism, feudal society” (< vṛṣṇa + darī “society”)
- vṛṣṇalitta (ablaut decl., pl. vṛṣṇalettyē) “feudal tax, duties of a vassal towards the seigneur” (< vṛṣṇa + √litt- “to gain”)
- varṣṇāvi “share of the produce that, under feudalism, villagers had to give their overlord” (< vṛṣṇa)
- vṛṣṇūrah “fief, granted land” (< vṛṣṇa)
- kamijilde “to administer” (< kami- “around” + √jild- “to act”)
- kamijeldanah “administration” (< kami-√jild-)
- ṣarikamijeldanah “civil service, bureaucracy, public administration” (< ṣari “lord”, possibly implying “ṣarivāṇa” (State) + kamijeldanah)


Day 28:
Chlouvānem — theme “pollution (part 2) and its mitigation”
- kāmilrimya “environmental-friendly action” (< kāmila “blue” + rimya “help”), this is a kind of “grue” situation: green and blue are the typical colours of nature in Chlouvānem culture, but environmentalism (kāmilāmita) uses blue, as it’s a kind of “average” colour between water, plants, and the sky. (Blue used this way is typically Chlouvānem; in worldwide politics it is the colour of communism (whence also e.g. the blue background on the flag of the Chlouvānem Inquisition) - ultimately influenced by the proto-communist novel and one of the classics of worldwide literature “The Blue Sky after the Storm” (Birṣų ānat kāmilire lairē) by Chlouvānem writer Jauhækumyāvi Nahinuyāša Lañimulca)
- kāmilrimilenas “environmental-friendly choice” (< kāmilrimya + lenas “choice”)
- ghūsnake (class 3 verb) “to filter”
- ghūsnas “filter” (< √ghūsn-)
- ghausnanah “filtering” (< √ghūsn-)
- vrāṣmaghūsnas “smoke filter” (< vrāṣmas “smoke” + ghūsnas)
- durtalka “sewage” (< Lällshag “dor tagek” (bad river))
- durtalkmaṇṭai (plurale tantum) “sewer(s)” (< durtalka + maṇṭai (pl. of “maṇṭa” (pipe)))
- durtalghūsnas “sewage filter” (< durtalka + ghūsnas)
- viṣṭargḍhūlam “noise barrier, sound wall” (< viṣ- “against, opposite” + ṭargas “noise” + ḍhūlam “shield”), also “viṣṭarḍhūlam” (which is by far more common in speech - [ʋiʂʈɐʀɡɖʱuːɴ̆ɐ̃m] vs. the easier [ʋiʂʈɐɻɖʱuːɴ̆ɐ̃m] - but less commonly written)

- ħāvas “pledge, security” (< √ħau-)
- ħāvoe “object that has been hired” (< √ħau-)
- ħāvāršis (derogatory) “person who does any kind of job, often illegally, just for the sake of getting richer” (< √ħau-)
- læchlijāṇa “funfair” (< √læchly- “to have fun” + jāṇa “field”)
- nairīvayīn “apprentice” (< na-√irī-ve- “to learn”)
- nairīvayaṇah “apprenticeship, internship” (< na-√irī-ve-) (synonym of the word “kēhanah” I already had)
- pūnṛṣūlāṇa “machinery” (collective of “pūnṛṣūs” (machine))
- nærjñunaigis “stirrup” (< √nærkh- “to ride, mount” + junai “foot” + -gis (here: “for”))

- kamityāna “perimeter, circumference” (< kami-√tyā- “to stand around, be around, to surround”)
- nītyāna “area, surface” (< nī-√tyā- “to stand within, be within”)

- mænaṣih “pyramid” (< Lällshag “mäna ci” ‘roof-like’)
- lǣṣa “cube; die” (some linguists reconstruct a Proto-Lahob root *ŋōwšo from that and Kȯtıme Qoşazırme derivation “mȯçıdun” (box, casket), while others think it’s a Tamukāyi borrowing)
- tilva “cone” (< Lällshag “tillwå” ‘pin’)
- abotake (class 9 verb: abotire - abeitirek - aɂabātirā) “to be flat” (easter egg)
