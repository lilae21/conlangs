  <h1>Easter eggs in Dundulanyä</h1>
  <p>Dundulanyä does have quite a few Easter eggs, some related to my native Lombardy, to Liguria, where I live, to real world languages, or things I just like. This page is mainly for tongue-in-cheek words, inside jokes, behind-the-scenes or otherwise Earth-related references; interesting, meaningful etymologies fitting into a deeper scheme belong in the <a href="autnotes.htm"><i>Author&apos;s notes and thoughts</i></a> page.</p>

  <p>If you&apos;d rather play along and see if you notice some &#8211; although admittedly quite a few of them are personal and/or obscure &#8211; <b>stop reading now and go back!</b></p>
  <p><b>anutu</b>, “space; heaven, invisible sky”, from the Sumerian deities An and Utu.</p>
  <p><b>babai</b>, a kind of scary spirit, sometimes outright evil, in Dundulanyä (Taktapṣaikhulu) folklore. The word is a subtle reference to the <i>Ultracorpi</i> and <i>Generali</i> by Italian artist Enrico Baj, as well as to the <i>babau</i>, a monster in Italian folklore.
  <p><b>cerṇūṣa</b>, “homeland, motherland”, referring to my hometown, Cernusch (Lombard: <span style="font-family:sans-serif;">[tʃerˈnysk]</span>).</p>
  <p><b>goldi</b>, “cat”, from the name of one of my cats.</p>
  <p><b>guśīna</b>, “farmhouse”, from the name, also in Lombard, of the farmhouse my grandfather was born in, in 1926.</p>
  <p><b>hīmba</b>, “color; musical scale, <i>rāga</i>”, referring to the Himba people of Namibia and their crosslinguistically unique way of naming colors.</p>
  <p><b>katanai</b>, “clutter”, not really an Easter egg, but it&apos;s the only word so far which I took from a natural language - in this case, Lombard - with the same meaning and without changing it in the slightest (aside from orthography).</p>
  <p><b>√lel-</b> “to live”, but more specifically its derivation <b>lila</b> “person”, which reflects how since about 2014-15 I&apos;ve been using online nicknames (and even a name I use for myself in my inner thoughts!) centered around the syllable <span style="font-family:sans-serif;">[li]</span> or the sequence <span style="font-family:sans-serif;">[lil]</span>, which is a baby-talk-ish wordplay on my given name. <small>And as a fun fact, I have lambdacism and can&apos;t even pronounce the sound <span style="font-family:sans-serif;">[l]</span>... as I assume y&apos;all reading this to be familiar with terminology on phonetics, I pronounce something like a nasalized uvular flap instead.</small></p>
  <p><b>lūla</b>, “car”, as a rather obscure reference to the song “Dove ho messo la Golf?” by Offlaga&nbsp;Disco&nbsp;Pax.</p>
  <p><b>lūlunyeke</b>, the slang word for “blowjob”, or rather its etymology being a derivation from <i>lūluna</i> “cocoa, chocolate”, is a reference to another Offlaga&nbsp;Disco&nbsp;Pax song, “Cioccolato I.A.C.P.”.</p>
  <p><b>setole</b> “souvenir”, yet another Offlaga&nbsp;Disco&nbsp;Pax reference (“De&nbsp;Fonseca”). The Dundulanyä etymology is actually <i>se-</i> “with” + <i>tole</i> “tally mark, notch”.</b></p>
  <p><b>śvästya</b> “newspaper”, as a reference to the Soviet <i>Izvestija</i>. Chlouvānem &#8211; which had a lot more Soviet easter eggs &#8211; had a word with the same meaning referring to the <i>Pravda</i> instead. The Dundulanyä etymology is the uncommon root <i>√śväs-</i> “to announce, proclaim” plus the singulative suffix <i>-tya</i>.</p>

  <p>Finally, while not Easter eggs in the language itself, a few of the translations and example sentences are taken from songs, books, or even memes.</p>
