  <p><strong>Tarueb</strong> (endoglossonym <i>Taruebedës</i> or <i>rudës taruebed</i>; IPA <span class="ipa">[tʰaɾu(ʔ)e'bed(ǝ)z]</span>, <span class="ipa">['rudǝz tʰaɾu'(ʔ)ebed]</span>) is the language of the Tarueb people, native to the country of Taruebus in Central <a href="../places/xacoro.htm">Xacoro</a>. Tarueb is one of the most widely known languages on <a href="../eventoa.htm">Eventoa</a> and the most spoken Xacoran language; in the West, although Tarueb proficiency is rather low, it is known due to the mass phenomenon of Tarueb pop culture, especially in the last thirty years.

  <h2 id="PHO">Morphology</h2>
    <h3 id="PROSODY">Prosody</h3>
      <p>Tarueb has fixed, predictable stress, which always falls on the penultimate syllable unless it contains the vowel <span class="ipa">/ǝ/</span> <b>ë</b>, in which case the antipenultimate is stressed. Stress falls on <b>ë</b> anyway if there is no preceding syllable it can be backed onto.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>pašmel</b> "animal" &#8212; <span class="ipa">/paʃmer/ ['paʃmeɫ]</span>;</li>
        <li><b>berëtalp</b> "fifteen" &#8212; <span class="ipa">/berǝtarp/ ['beɾǝtalp]</span> (colloquially <span class="ipa">['beltalp]</span>);</li>
        <li><b>ġërak</b> "ball" &#8212; <span class="ipa">/ʁǝrak/ ['ʁǝɾak]</span>;</li>
        <li>but <b>oġërak</b> "your ball" &#8212; <span class="ipa">/oʁǝrak/ ['oʁǝɾak]</span>.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2 id="MOR">Morphology</h2>
    <h3 id="VERB">Verbs</h3>
    <p>Tarueb verbs are moderately inflected, however, there is a quite small class of verbs which can be directly inflected (synthetically), while the majority of verbs is only conjugated in analytic forms, using one of the synthetically inflected verbs as auxiliary.</p>
      <h4 id="VBAFFIXES">Verbal affixes</h4>
      <p>The following table shows the person conjugation of Tarueb:</p>
      <div class="inlinetable"><table>
        <caption>Tarueb person conjugation</caption>
        <tr><th rowspan="2"></th>
          <th colspan="2">Subject</th>
          <th colspan="2">Object</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>Singular</th>
          <th>Plural</th>
          <th>Singular</th>
          <th>Plural</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>First person</th>
          <td>š-/šë-</td>
          <td>tso-</td>
          <td>-šk-/-ëšk-</td>
          <td>-seġ(ë)-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>Second person</th>
          <td>o-</td>
          <td>žod-</td>
          <td>-už-</td>
          <td>-uġž-/-uġëž-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>Third person</th>
          <td>∅-</td>
          <td>ġu-</td>
          <td>-k-</td>
          <td>-kun-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>Fourth person/obviative</th>
          <td colspan="2">rë-</td>
          <td colspan="2">-ër-/-ël-</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>The above subject prefixes, appended to nouns (with <b>t(ë)-</b> for the third person singular), form possessives, e.g. <i>šëkeġed</i> "my salutation", <i>oġurem</i> "your (sg.) brother", <i>ġuxafëzd</i> "their son".</p>
      <h4 id="TENSEASP">Tense and aspect markers</h4>
      <p>Tense, tense-aspect, and some TAM markers come in the last slot of the verbal complex:</p>
      <div class="inlinetable"><table>
        <caption>Tarueb tense and aspect markers</caption>
        <tr><th>Tense/tense-aspect/TAM combination</th>
          <th>Suffix</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>Present (continuous/progressive)</th><td>-(a)z</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Aorist (gnomic)</th><td>-y<br>-∅ <small>after consonants</small></td></tr>
        <tr><th>Perfective past</th><td>-t</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Imperfect</th><td>-ol</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Pluperfect</th><td>-širo</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Future</th><td>-ko, -go</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Conditional</th><td>-rëš</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Future-in-the-past</th><td>-roško</td></tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>See as examples the synthetic verb <i>šëmagz</i> "I am coming", <i>šëšol</i> "I am", and the analytic verb <i>genžo šëšolz</i> "I am breathing". Many synthetic forms can be replaced by analytic ones, such as "I am coming" rendered as <i>mago šëšolz</i>.</p>
      <p>Note that verbal adjuncts such as adverbs can come between the verb and the auxiliary: <i>genž' esag šëšolz</i> "I am breathing fast".</p>


  <h2 id="ORI">External history</h2>
    <p>Tarueb is the first conlang I started after I had already sketched (but not published) the structure of this website. At first, it was a <i>divertissement</i>, but then I decided to add it as one of the main languages of Eventoa.</p>
    <p>
    Tarueb started as a weird idea during a sleepless night in February 2025: I was looking at old spreadsheets in my archives and I found a conlang I was working on over ten years before, named <i>Lāynahīmṭa</i>: it was a conlang that I had even shared on social media before, and, that means, one of the many "spiritual ancestors" of Dundulanyä. It filled that niche in an old version of Calémere and was &#8211; according to a chronology I myself have some trouble reconstructing and remembering &#8211; likely the last language before sometime around late January/early February 2015 with the next conlang in this sort of "lineage" many roots were changed, some of which last to this day in Dundulanyä.</p>
    <p>
    The idea behind Tarueb was simple: what if I took roots from a ten year old, immature conlang of mine, regularized some features and changed the phonology, and made a whole new grammar? In the last version of Calémere I had done a really similar thing, taking the first "serious" conlang of mine, Valdimelic, resulting in Qualdomelic; now I wanted to do a similar, but more far-reaching thing, in Eventoa. So, the morning after, Tarueb started taking shape on paper and in bytes.</p>
    <p>
    Tarueb&apos;s name is actually much older. The countries and territories of Taruebus, Ceria, Spocius and Nordûlik (the latter having changed a few spellings), as well as a few minor recurring ones, have existed in nearly every conworld project of mine ever since a map I had sketched sometime around 2007. However in the last installments of Calémere, unlike the other three, Tarueb changed nature multiple times: in the versions of Calémere with "Laceyiam II" and III, Tarueb was a distant relative of those languages, while in the version with Chlouvānem it was a completely distinct language (which never became more than a sketch) whose speakers had a contemporary history interlaced with the Chlouvānem. However, in Eventoa, for the first time Tarueb and Taruebus are among the main languages and territories of the planet.</p>
