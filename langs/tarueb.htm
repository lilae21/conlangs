  <p><strong>Tarueb</strong> (endoglossonym <i>Taruebedës</i> or <i>rudës taruebed</i>; IPA <span style="font-family:sans-serif;">[tʰaɾu(ʔ)e'bed(ǝ)z]</span>, <span style="font-family:sans-serif;">['rudǝz tʰaɾu'(ʔ)ebed]</span>) is the language of the Tarueb people, native to the country of Taruebus in Central <a href="../places/xacoro.htm">Xacoro</a>. Tarueb is one of the most widely known languages on <a href="../eventoa.htm">Eventoa</a> and the most spoken Xacoran language; in the West, although Tarueb proficiency is rather low, it is known due to the mass phenomenon of Tarueb pop culture, especially in the last thirty years.

  <h2 id="PHO">Morphology</h2>
    <h3 id="PROSODY">Prosody</h3>
      <p>Tarueb has fixed, predictable stress, which always falls on the penultimate syllable unless it contains the vowel <span style="font-family:sans-serif;">/ǝ/</span> <b>ë</b>, in which case the antipenultimate is stressed. Stress falls on <b>ë</b> anyway if there is no preceding syllable it can be backed onto.</p>

  <h2 id="ORI">External history</h2>
    <p>Tarueb is the first conlang I started after I had already sketched (but not published) the structure of this website. At first, it was a <i>divertissement</i>, but then I decided to add it as one of the main languages of Eventoa.</p>
    <p>
    Tarueb started as a weird idea during a sleepless night in February 2025: I was looking at old spreadsheets in my archives and I found a conlang I was working on over ten years before, named <i>Lāynahīmṭa</i>: it was a conlang that I had even shared on social media before, and, that means, one of the many "spiritual ancestors" of Dundulanyä. It filled that niche in an old version of Calémere and was &#8211; according to a chronology I myself have some trouble reconstructing and remembering &#8211; likely the last language before sometime around late January/early February 2015 with the next conlang in this sort of "lineage" many roots were changed, some of which last to this day in Dundulanyä.</p>
    <p>
    The idea behind Tarueb was simple: what if I took roots from a ten year old, immature conlang of mine, regularized some features and changed the phonology, and made a whole new grammar? In the last version of Calémere I had done a really similar thing, taking the first "serious" conlang of mine, Valdimelic, resulting in Qualdomelic; now I wanted to do a similar, but more far-reaching thing, in Eventoa. So, the morning after, Tarueb started taking shape on paper and in bytes.</p>
    <p>
    Tarueb&apos;s name is actually much older. The countries and territories of Taruebus, Ceria, Spocius and Nordûlik (the latter having changed a few spellings), as well as a few minor recurring ones, have existed in nearly every conworld project of mine ever since a map I had sketched sometime around 2007. However in the last installments of Calémere, unlike the other three, Tarueb changed nature multiple times: in the versions of Calémere with "Laceyiam II" and III, Tarueb was a distant relative of those languages, while in the version with Chlouvānem it was a completely distinct language (which never became more than a sketch) whose speakers had a contemporary history interlaced with the Chlouvānem. However, in Eventoa, for the first time Tarueb and Taruebus are among the main languages and territories of the planet.</p>
